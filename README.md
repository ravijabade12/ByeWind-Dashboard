## 🎯 Key Components

### Dashboard
- **MetricCard**: Displays key performance indicators with trend indicators
- **LineChart**: Revenue visualization with current/previous period comparison
- **BarChart**: Projections vs Actuals comparison
- **DonutChart**: Sales breakdown by channel
- **WorldMap**: Revenue by geographic location

### Data Management
- **DataTable**: Advanced table with sorting, filtering, pagination, and row selection
- **StatusBadge**: Color-coded status indicators with animations
- **SearchInput**: Real-time search with debouncing

### UI Primitives
- **Button**: Multiple variants (primary, secondary, ghost, icon) with hover states
- **Input**: Form inputs with validation states and icons
- **Avatar**: User profile images with fallback generation

## 🌟 Design Decisions & Challenges

### Performance Optimizations
- **Component Memoization**: Used React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implemented for large data sets in tables
- **Image Optimization**: Used WebP format with fallbacks and lazy loading
- **Bundle Splitting**: Code splitting for better initial load times

### Accessibility Improvements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color ratios

### Challenges Faced
1. **Chart Responsiveness**: Creating SVG charts that scale properly across all screen sizes
2. **Theme Consistency**: Ensuring all components work seamlessly in both light and dark modes
3. **Animation Performance**: Balancing smooth animations with performance on lower-end devices
4. **Data Table Complexity**: Implementing advanced features while maintaining performance

### Improvements Made
- **Custom Chart Components**: Built from scratch for better performance than chart libraries
- **Theme System**: Comprehensive dark/light mode with system preference detection
- **Mobile Navigation**: Optimized navigation patterns for mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Added skeleton screens and loading indicators throughout
